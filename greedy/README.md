# Greedy Algorithms

_"The point is, ladies and gentleman, greed is good."_ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€“ Gordon Gekko, [Wall Street (1987)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

Greedy algorithms are a problem solving approach where the algorithm choses a local optimal choice at each step, with the intent of finding the global optimal solution. A greedy algorithm does not always produce _the_ best optimal solution, but it at least approximates to it within a reasonable amount of time.

**Tasks sorted by end point**

## Build and run

Create a directory to host the binary executable. This helps to keep the source control clean, as the `bin` directory is ignored in commits.

```bash
mkdir bin
```

This is a header only project. There is only need to build the main file. The headers, with their implementations, will be built in just one step.

```bash
clang++ main.cpp -std=c++17 -O3 -W -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o ./bin/greedy
```

```bash
./bin/greedy [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ]
```
