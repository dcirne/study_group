# Study Group

This repository contains sample code and basic instructions for the ongoing study group.

## Getting started

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dcirne/study_group.git
cd study_group
```

## How to use it

Each directory contains code, usage instructions, and the basics of a topic we have approached in the study group. Change into the directory of interest and read its README file.

## Requirements

The code should work with no problems on Linux and/or macOS. We are assuming you have a compiler supporting at least [C++ 17](https://isocpp.org/std/status) ([clang](https://clang.llvm.org) or [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org)), and Python 3.4 or above.

Most of the examples are built using clang. However, there should be no issues when built using gcc.
